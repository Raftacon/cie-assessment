# Overview

This is a very basic configuration with minimal extra libraries to help demonstrate the valid login scenario from the technical assessment (â€”as well as some additional cases, like test cases from the manual part of the assessment & an example of an assertion failure.)

A quick reproduction of the screen from the manual assessment can be found [here](https://raftacon.io/cie/) and is used as the destination for the end-to-end testing in this repo. (The manual part of this assessment can also be found as a PDF in the `manual` subfolder.)

## Assumption

* `chromedriver` for your local version of Chrome is already installed & added to **PATH**.

## Usage

A test run can be observed by pulling down the repo & running:

```python -m suites.login_suite```


At the start of each run, the **screenshots** folder is scrubbed in preparation of the next suite execution. After each test case, a screenshot of the test case result is taken as part of the `tearDown` step.

Some sample output (including the intentional-fail test case):

```python
======================================================================
FAIL: test_wrong_notification_message_displayed (tests.test_login.SignInPageTests)

## Future Improvements:
* Implement configuration to easily cycle Selenium targets between Chrome, Firefox, etc.
* Either roll on template or find a better library to prettify results.
